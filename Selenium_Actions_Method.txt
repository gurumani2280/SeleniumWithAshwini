1. MoveToElement

Creating action class object , we need to pass driver in the constructor
We are identifying the element, on which mouse over operation should be performed
Actual action is performed
eg:	 
Actions actions=new Actions(driver);
WebElement menu = driver.findElement(By.linkText("Enabled"));
actions.moveToElement(menu).perform();
